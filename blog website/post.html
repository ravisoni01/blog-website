                Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design
                philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language
                constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                large-scale projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often
                described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to
                the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list
                comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with
                version 2.7 in 2020. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not
                completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. With Python
                2's end-of-life (and pip having dropped support in 2021), only Python 3.6.xand later are
                supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not restricted to
                64-bit Windows).
            </p>
            <p>
                Python interpreters are supported for mainstream operating systems and available for a few more (and in
                the past supported many more). A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free
                and open-sourcereference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation,
                manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
